A simple Find and Replace program made for a college assignment,
all you need to do is run cmd in the same directory and type main.

The first string is the main string in which find and replace will happen, second input is for the string which is to be found
in the first string, the third inpt is for what you wanna replace with the found string.

Enjoy!
